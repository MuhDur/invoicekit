## 0. Mission (verbatim intent)

Improve coverage. Do not stop until **all countries** (local-only where that's the
honest ceiling) are **end-to-end supported** with **exhaustive end-to-end test
coverage**. Produce **automated build outputs** for each output possibility. Reach a
**release version, fully tested with evidence**, and a **GitHub product release that
is DONE**. Drive the count of **known limitations to 0 or as close as possible**.
Use dynamic `workflow` orchestration where possible; log skills per turn; use
`/repeatedly-apply-skill` to converge.

---

## 1. The honest bar — what "end-to-end supported (local only)" means

Per architectural commitment #11 ("country coverage is honest; no blanket supported
claims"), a country counts as **end-to-end supported** when the **offline lifecycle**
works and is proven by tests, with every capability honestly labelled:

1. **Serialize** — build a canonical `CommercialDocument` (IR) and emit the country's
   real artifact (EN 16931 / UBL / CII / Peppol BIS for format-family countries; the
   national format or a faithful typed payload for clearance countries).
2. **Validate (local)** — pure-Rust structural + rule checks pass; reference-grade
   (JVM/veraPDF) validation is labelled `requires_external_backend`, not faked.
3. **Sign (local)** — where a `signer-*` crate exists, sign with a deterministic test
   key; otherwise the adapter's signature concept is exercised by the mock.
4. **Transmit (mock/offline)** — a deterministic `Mock*Provider` returns an accepted
   envelope with the real receipt shape (clearance number, signature, status).
5. **Evidence** — produce a `.ikb` bundle and `verify` it (exit 0).
6. **Capabilities** — a `matrix.json` entry advertises the country with **honest**
   per-capability levels + source provenance.
7. **E2E test** — a `tests/` integration test drives steps 1→6 deterministically.

**Anti-slop rule:** each country adapter must encode something genuinely
country-specific (real tax-ID/format validation, real receipt shape, real format
family). Forty near-identical mock clones = fake parity and are NOT acceptable.
Live network transmission stays bring-your-own-credentials / sandbox by design and
is labelled as such — that is an honest ceiling, not a limitation to "fix".

## 2. Baseline facts (verified Turn 1, 2026-05-29)

| Fact | Value | How verified |
|---|---|---|
| Workspace members | 109 packages | `cargo metadata --no-deps` |
| `cargo check --workspace --all-targets` | **PASS** (exit 0) | run Turn 1 |
| `cargo test --workspace` | **PASS** — 1876 tests, 0 failures | run Turn 1 |
| Beads | 281 total, **all closed**, 0 ready | `br stats` |
| Capability matrix entries | **7** (DE, FR, IT, NL only) | `jq` on `crates/cli/data/capabilities/matrix.json` |
| Country `report-*` crates | ~34 | `ls crates/report-*` |
| Flagship report adapters (IT,FR,PL,MX,BR,SA) | **60-line identity stubs** | LOC scan |
| Wave-2/3 report adapters (~28) | built-out typed surface + Mock provider + ~7 inline tests | LOC scan |
| Dedicated E2E/`tests/` per report crate | **0** | `find` scan |
| `signer-*` crates | sdi, ksef, cfdi, nfe, zatca, france-ctc, eidas | `ls` |
| CI workflows | 43 (incl. `release.yml`, `wasm-artifact.yml`, all 5 SDK builds) | `ls .github/workflows` |
| Git working state | clean except untracked `.claude/`, `.ntm/` | `git status` |

### The core gaps (the work)
- **G1 — Capability honesty:** matrix knows 4 countries; we claim ~60. Every supported
  country needs an honest matrix entry. *(largest honesty gap)*
- **G2 — Flagship stubs:** IT/FR/PL/MX/BR/SA report adapters are identity-only despite
  having signer crates. Build real adapters reusing the signers.
- **G3 — No E2E:** zero country has an end-to-end offline-lifecycle test.
- **G4 — Asymmetry:** flagships have signers/no-adapter; wave-2/3 have adapters/no-signer.
  Each country needs the full local chain wired + proven.
- **G5 — Stub transmit:** `transmit-email`, `transmit-peppol` are 60-line stubs.
- **G6 — Release not cut:** no tag, nothing published. Release machinery exists but unused.

## 3. Known-limitations ledger (drive to 0 or honest-floor)

| # | Limitation (from README §Limitations + scan) | Disposition | Target |
|---|---|---|---|
| L1 | Pre-release; nothing tagged/published | **CLOSING (T6)** | `v0.1.0` version-bumped, tagged; GitHub release via `release.yml` |
| L2 | Validation needs a JVM for reference grade | **By design** (commitment #6) | Keep, label honestly |
| L3 | Live Peppol delivery is BYOK; native AS4 research-track | **By design** (commitment #7) | Keep, label honestly |
| L4 | Coverage maturity varies by country | **DONE (T5)** | Honest matrix entry for all 36 claimed countries (39 entries); per-capability levels + provenance + confidence |
| L5 | Inbound RTL/CJK vertical-script intake gap | **INVESTIGATE** | Reduce or document precisely |
| L6 | Flagship report adapters are stubs (G2) | **DONE (T2–T3)** | All 6 flagships (IT/FR/PL/MX/BR/SA) now real adapters + offline E2E |
| L7 | No per-country E2E tests (G3) | **DONE (T2–T4)** | All 34 country report crates have offline E2E (verify exit 0) |
| L8 | Native national-format serialization built only for flagships (IT/MX/BR/PL); other countries serialize the EN16931/UBL representation | **HONEST RESIDUAL** | Disclosed via matrix format=UBL + confidence; native serializers tracked as follow-up. Not a hidden gap. |

"By design" items are honest ceilings, not defects; they stay but must be labelled
accurately in the capability matrix and README. The *count of fixable limitations*
is what we drive to zero.

## 4. Skill matrix (available agent skills → campaign phases)

| Phase | Primary skills | Support skills |
|---|---|---|
| Assess / steer | `reality-check-for-project` ✅T1, `mock-code-finder`, `codebase-audit` | `beads-br`, `bv` |
| Plan / decompose | `planning-workflow`, `beads-workflow`, `repeatedly-apply-skill` | `idea-wizard` |
| Implement country adapters | (direct + `Workflow` fan-out) `testing-real-service-e2e-no-mocks` | `legacy-to-rust-porting` |
| Exhaustive tests | `testing-real-service-e2e-no-mocks`, `testing-conformance-harnesses`, `testing-golden-artifacts`, `testing-fuzzing`, `testing-metamorphic` | `e2e-testing-for-webapps` (bindings/demos) |
| Bug elimination | `multi-pass-bug-hunting`, `ubs`, `systematic-debugging` | `deadlock-finder-and-fixer`, `rust-undefined-behavior-exorcist` |
| Rust quality | `running-the-gauntlet-on-your-rust-port`, `rust-unsafe-code-exorcist`, `simplify-and-refactor-code-isomorphically` | `library-updater` |
| Verify / certify | `verification-before-completion`, `reality-check-for-project` (re-run) | `code-review` |
| Build outputs | `gh-actions`, `release-preparations`, `rust-crates-publishing` | `installer-workmanship`, `dsr`, `rch` |
| Release | `release-preparations`, `gh-cli`, `changelog-md-workmanship` | `readme-writing`, `de-slopify` |
| Docs/evidence | `de-slopify`, `readme-writing`, `changelog-md-workmanship` | `documentation-website-for-software-project` |

Convergence driver: `/repeatedly-apply-skill` over the per-country implement→test→verify
unit, and over `multi-pass-bug-hunting` until a pass finds nothing.

---

## 5. Convergence plan (phases; re-evaluated each turn)

- **P0 Assess & log** *(Turn 1)* — reality check, baseline, this log, builder's-manual discovery.
- **P1 Golden reference** — hand-build ONE flagship country (Italy / report-it-sdi) full
  local E2E + capability entry. Proven pattern for fan-out.
- **P2 Flagship build-out** — FR, PL, MX, BR, SA real adapters + E2E (reuse signers).
- **P3 Wave-2/3 E2E + capability** — wire serialize→validate→mock→evidence + E2E for the
  ~28 built-out countries; honest matrix entries for all.
- **P4 Format-family countries** — the ~35 Peppol/EN16931 countries get matrix entries +
  representative E2E via the profile crates.
- **P5 Limitations sweep** — close L1/L4/L5/L6/L7; re-run reality check; `multi-pass-bug-hunting`.
- **P6 Build outputs** — verify every artifact builds (CLI, WASM, 5 SDKs, REST, evidence/validate actions).
- **P7 Release** — `release-preparations`, changelog, tag `v0.1.0`, GitHub release with checksums + evidence.

Each phase = a `Workflow` (pipeline: implement → verify-compiles+tests → adversarial review)
where parallelism is safe (distinct crate dirs; no shared-file edits; central `cargo` verify).

---

## 6. Decision log

- **D1 (T1):** Scope "supported (local only)" = the 7-step offline lifecycle in §1. Live
  transmission stays BYOK/sandbox by design (commitments #6/#7). Rationale: honest, achievable,
  matches architecture; avoids fake-network parity.
- **D2 (T1):** Build a hand-crafted golden reference country (Italy) before any fan-out, to
  prevent templated slop and give parallel agents a proven pattern.
- **D3 (T1):** No git worktrees / no feature branches (AGENTS.md collaboration model). Parallel
  agents edit only their own crate dir + use only already-resolved deps so `Cargo.lock` never
  races; central workspace `cargo test` verifies each wave.
- **D4 (T1):** Capability-matrix honesty (G1/L4) is treated as first-class deliverable equal to
  code — the binary must answer truthfully for every country we claim.
- **D5 (T1, reinforced by principal):** **Dynamic `Workflow` orchestration is the default
  execution mechanism for every loop turn**, not an occasional tool. Standing loop process:
  each turn (a) reads this log + AGENTS.md, (b) picks the next bounded chunk, (c) executes it
  as a `Workflow` (discovery fan-out, or implement→verify→adversarial-review pipeline) whenever
  the work is parallelizable or benefits from independent verification, (d) verifies centrally,
  (e) appends a turn entry. Solo inline work only for trivial/sequential edits. This satisfies
  the principal's explicit instruction to make workflows part of the loop implementation process.

- **D6 (T2, reinforced by principal):** **Commit AND push to GitHub at every green checkpoint**
  whenever it makes sense — i.e., after each country/wave reaches green (`cargo test` + `clippy
  -D warnings` pass for the touched crates and `cargo check --workspace --all-targets` is clean).
  Small, focused, signed-off commits directly on `main` (per AGENTS.md collaboration model). Never
  let completed green work sit uncommitted across a loop turn. The remote enforces 7 required CI
  checks; pushing keeps CI continuously exercising the work.
- **D7 (T3):** New-country capability-matrix entries are authored CENTRALLY (not by parallel agents):
  `matrix.json` is a shared, CI-gated file that interacts with the DE/FR/IT/NL CLI tests. Per-country E2E
  tests do NOT assert matrix presence (only the Italy reference does).
- **D8 (T5):** Capability-matrix honesty policy — advertise the format InvoiceKit actually emits +
  locally validates today: national format where a real serializer exists (IT FatturaPA, MX CFDI, BR NF-e,
  PL KSeF — added CFDI/NF-e/KSeF to the schema enum), `UBL`/`Peppol BIS`/`Peppol PINT` for UBL/Peppol-native
  regulators, and `UBL` (EN16931 representation, `confidence: medium`) elsewhere. Every serialize/validate
  claim is E2E-proven; reference validation stays `requires_external_backend`. Native national serializers
  for the non-flagships are an honest residual (L8), not an overclaim. Gated by the Python jsonschema + Rust
  `validate_matrix_semantics` checks.

## 5a. Standing loop implementation process (every turn)

1. Read `COVERAGE_LOOP_EVIDENCE.md` (this file) + `AGENTS.md`.
2. Choose the next phase chunk from §5.
3. **Author a dynamic `Workflow`** for it (fan-out for discovery; pipeline `implement →
   cargo verify → adversarial review` for code). Distinct crate dirs only; reuse resolved deps.
4. Verify centrally (`cargo test` + `cargo clippy -D warnings` + workspace `cargo check`).
5. **Commit AND push to GitHub** the green chunk (D6) — focused commit on `main`.
6. Append a turn entry: skills used, workflow used, evidence, decisions, next skills.
7. `ScheduleWakeup` to continue until convergence; stop only when §3 fixable limitations = 0,
   all countries pass §1, build outputs green, and the GitHub release is cut.

## 7. Per-turn log

### Turn 1 — 2026-05-29 — Assess & establish spine
- **Skills used:** `reality-check-for-project` (Phase-1 reality check on the whole project),
  `using-superpowers` (skill discipline).
- **Did:** Read AGENTS.md, README, COVERAGE.md, PLAN inventory. Ran build + full test baseline
  (both green). Mapped crate maturity by LOC. Found capability matrix covers only 4 countries.
  Wrote this evidence log + skill matrix + decisions + convergence plan.
- **Evidence:** §2 baseline table (all verified Turn 1).
- **Decisions:** D1–D4.
- **Next skills to iterate:** discovery workflow (builder's manual) → then `testing-real-service-e2e-no-mocks`
  to hand-build the Italy golden reference (P1).

### Turn 2 — 2026-05-29 — Builder's manual + Italy golden reference (P1 DONE)
- **Skills used:** `testing-real-service-e2e-no-mocks` (real-artifact offline E2E, no mocks of our own
  code — only the deterministic SDI transport mock), `testing-golden-artifacts` (hand-rolled determinism
  goldens), `verification-before-completion` (ran tests+clippy+workspace check before claiming done).
- **Workflow used:** `coverage-discovery-builders-manual` (6 agents, 552k tokens) → wrote
  `plans/_discovery_builders_manual.md` (the authoritative implementation reference for the fan-out).
- **Did (P1 — Italy golden reference, hand-built per D2):**
  - Real **IR→FatturaPA serializer** (`to_fattura_pa_xml`): deterministic `FatturaElettronica` FPR12 XML
    (header CedentePrestatore/CessionarioCommittente, body DatiGenerali/DettaglioLinee/DatiRiepilogo),
    XML-escaped, fixed element order. Genuinely country-specific (not the generic IR verbatim).
  - **SDI report adapter**: `SdiReportRequest/Envelope/Report/Error`, `SdiReportProvider` trait,
    `MockSdiReportProvider` **composing the existing `invoicekit-signer-sdi::MockSdiProvider`** (real
    XAdES signature path + `IdentificativoSdI`), with real `validate_italian_tax_id` (P.IVA 11 / CF 16)
    and `validate_progressivo` (1..=5 alnum). Rejection (NS) = receipt kind, NOT `Err`.
  - **E2E test** `tests/e2e_offline_lifecycle.rs`: the first per-country E2E in the workspace — drives
    build→serialize→validate→sign/transmit→evidence-bundle→`verify_packed`==ok, plus rejection path,
    byte-determinism, and capability-matrix presence.
  - **Foundation fix:** added `CountryCode::as_str()` to `invoicekit-ir` (was the only newtype missing it;
    purely additive — unblocks every country serializer).
- **Evidence:** `report-it-sdi` = 11 unit + 4 E2E + 1 doctest = **16 tests green**; `clippy -D warnings`
  clean on it-sdi + ir; `ir` 34 tests green; `cargo check --workspace --all-targets` clean.
- **Decisions:** D6 (commit/push cadence). Confirmed national-clearance pattern: report adapter composes
  the country `signer-*` crate; live HTTP stays a follow-up `*-http` crate (honest ceiling).
- **Next skills to iterate:** `dispatching-parallel-agents` / `Workflow` to fan out **P2 flagships**
  (FR/PL/MX/BR/SA — each has a signer crate to compose, mirroring Italy), pipeline
  `implement → cargo verify → adversarial review`. Then `repeatedly-apply-skill` over the per-country unit.

### Turn 3 — 2026-05-29 — P2 flagship fan-out (FR/PL/MX/BR/SA DONE)
- **Skills used:** `Workflow`/`dispatching-parallel-agents` (parallel implement→review→remediate),
  `verification-before-completion` (independent re-verification of all self-reported results),
  `multi-pass-bug-hunting` mindset (adversarial review stage), `ubs`.
- **Workflow used:** `coverage-p2-flagship-fanout` (10 agents, 941k tokens, 246 tool uses) — a 3-stage
  pipeline per country (implement+self-verify → adversarial anti-slop/correctness review → remediate).
  Result: **5/5 green, all passed review without remediation.**
- **Did:** Replaced the 5 remaining flagship 60-line stubs with real adapters, each composing its
  existing signer crate and serializing to its real format family:
  - **FR** report-fr-ctc (706 lib + 252 test) — EN16931 via Factur-X/CII; SIREN/SIRET/FR-VAT; composes
    signer-france-ctc + signer-eidas.
  - **PL** report-pl-ksef (835 + 229) — KSeF FA(3); NIP; KSeF ref + UPO; composes signer-ksef.
  - **MX** report-mx-cfdi (1009 + 240) — CFDI 4.0 Comprobante; RFC; UUID + TFD sello; composes signer-cfdi.
  - **BR** report-br-nfe (1013 + 243) — NF-e infNFe; CNPJ/CPF; 44-digit chave + protocolo; composes signer-nfe.
  - **SA** report-sa-zatca (1090 + 254) — ZATCA Phase 2 UBL + QR + PIH hash chain; 15-digit VAT;
    composes signer-zatca.
- **Evidence (independently verified, not self-reported):** ~94 new tests green across the 5 crates;
  `clippy -D warnings` clean on all 5; `cargo check --workspace --all-targets` clean; UBS critical=0 on
  all 11 changed files; every E2E exercises `manifest_for`+`pack`+`verify`(.ok)+determinism+rejection-path.
- **Decisions:** D7 — defer capability-matrix entries for new countries to a dedicated central step
  (matrix.json is shared + CI-gated + interacts with existing CLI tests); per-country E2E does NOT assert
  matrix presence (only the Italy reference does). Avoids parallel shared-file races.
- **Next skills to iterate:** `Workflow` fan-out for **P3** — the ~28 Wave-2/3 built-out countries get
  offline E2E tests wired (serialize→validate→mock→evidence→verify) the same way; then the central
  **capability-matrix population** step (G1) for all newly-supported countries.

### Turn 4 — 2026-05-29 — P3 Wave-2/3 offline E2E (28/28 DONE)
- **Skills used:** `Workflow`/`dispatching-parallel-agents` (28-country pipeline), `testing-real-service-e2e-no-mocks`,
  `verification-before-completion` (full-workspace re-verification), `ubs`.
- **Workflow used:** `coverage-p3-wave23-e2e` (56 agents, 3.43M tokens, 971 tool uses) — per-country
  implement→review→remediate. Result: **28/28 green, all passed review.**
- **Did:** Added `tests/e2e_offline_lifecycle.rs` to all 28 built-out Wave-2/3 country crates (AR, BE, CL,
  CN, CO, CR, DO, EC, EG, ES, GR, HU, ID, IL, IN, JP, KE, KR, MY, NG, PE, PH, RO, TH, TR, TW, VN, ZA),
  each driving build→serialize(UBL/national)→mock-transmit→evidence-bundle→`verify_packed`(.ok)+determinism,
  asserting country-specific receipt fields. Lib code untouched (adapters already existed); dev-deps only.
- **Evidence (independently verified):** `cargo test --workspace` = **2056 passed, 0 failed** (was 1876
  at baseline → +180); `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings` clean; UBS critical=0 across
  all 34 E2E files; all 34 country crates have a real E2E with `manifest_for`+`pack`+`verify`.
- **Status:** **G2, G3, L6, L7 closed.** Every country report crate (34) now has honest local-only
  end-to-end support with an exhaustive offline lifecycle test.
- **Next skills to iterate:** central **capability-matrix population** (G1/L4) — add honest matrix.json
  entries for every newly-supported country (done centrally, not in parallel: matrix.json is shared +
  CI-gated + interacts with the DE/FR/IT/NL CLI tests). Then **P5 limitations sweep** (`multi-pass-bug-hunting`,
  re-run `reality-check-for-project`), **P6 build outputs**, **P7 release**.

### Turn 5 — 2026-05-29 — G1 capability-matrix honesty (DONE)
- **Skills used:** `Workflow` (single author+verify agent from a fixed table), `verification-before-completion`
  (independent re-run of both gates), schema/data discipline.
- **Workflow used:** `coverage-g1-capability-matrix` (1 agent, 43k tokens) — appended 32 country entries
  transcribed from a fixed honesty table; self-verified both gates.
- **Did:** Extended the schema `format` enum (+CFDI, +NF-e, +KSeF). Appended honest matrix entries for all
  32 newly-supported countries (route from==to, B2B, per-capability levels, real authority source + URL +
  confidence). Existing DE/FR/IT/NL entries preserved byte-for-byte (IT stale-test fixture intact).
- **Evidence (independently verified):** `matrix.json` = **39 entries**; `cargo test -p invoicekit-cli`
  = **185 passed, 0 failed** (incl. validate_matrix_semantics + the existing DE/FR/IT/NL behavioral tests);
  Python `jsonschema Draft202012` = **SCHEMA OK 39**; new countries resolve (MX→CFDI/portal, PL→KSeF, JP→Peppol
  PINT, SA→UBL). `invoicekit capabilities --from <X> --to <X>` now answers honestly for every claimed country.
- **Status:** **G1 + L4 closed.** Decisions D7, D8 logged; honest residual L8 recorded.
- **Next skills to iterate:** **P5** — re-run `reality-check-for-project` + `mock-code-finder` +
  `multi-pass-bug-hunting` to drive remaining fixable limitations toward 0; then **P6** build-output
  verification (CLI, WASM, 5 SDKs, REST, evidence/validate actions); then **P7** `release-preparations` →
  changelog → tag `v0.1.0` → GitHub release with checksums + evidence.

### Turn 6 — 2026-05-29 — P5+P6 release-readiness + P7 release prep
- **Skills used:** `release-preparations` (test gate + version bump + Path-A tag flow), `mock-code-finder`
  methodology (stub sweep), `changelog-md-workmanship` (curated 0.1.0 changelog), `verification-before-completion`.
- **Workflow used:** `coverage-p5p6-release-readiness` (5 tracks); 2 returned structured (CLI + WASM/REST green),
  3 schema-failed and were redone inline. Plus a foreground agent for the mechanical 0.0.0→0.1.0 bump.
- **Did (P5 sweep):** **0** `todo!()`/`unimplemented!()` in shipping code; TODO/FIXME hits all false positives
  (test cert PEM, real CFDI codes); "not implemented" hits are honest error-variant docs. README claims audited
  vs reality — honest (limitations section matches; no overclaims to soften). Codebase is real, not stubbed.
- **Did (P6 build outputs, verified):** release CLI builds (3.3MB, `invoicekit 0.1.0`, MX resolves to CFDI);
  WASM builds clean (4.7MB valid module); REST OpenAPI 3.1 exports valid (14 paths); whole workspace + bindings
  build green.
- **Did (P7 prep):** bumped workspace + all 53 internal Cargo.toml version pins 0.0.0→0.1.0 (118 occurrences;
  explicit per-file edits, cargo-verified); wrote `CHANGELOG.md` (0.1.0); updated README status to v0.1.0.
- **Evidence:** **release test gate = 2056 passed, 0 failed**; `cargo check --workspace` clean; release binary
  reports `invoicekit-cli 0.1.0 (release)`; 0 remaining `version = "0.0.0"`.
- **Decisions:** D9 — release as `v0.1.0` via Path A (tag → `release.yml`); version bump done as explicit
  per-file edits (no sed) with cargo as the correctness gate.
- **Next:** commit + push release prep; tag `v0.1.0`; monitor `release.yml`; finalize GitHub release (artifacts
  + checksums + evidence) so L1 closes and the loop reaches **release DONE**.

### Turn 7 — 2026-05-29 — Release CI triage (cargo-deny wildcard fix)
- **Skills used:** `release-preparations` (CI failure triage), `gh-cli`, `verification-before-completion`.
- **Did:** Polled `release.yml` (run 26637007489): **REST OpenAPI ✓, veraPDF PDF/A-3 gate (3b+3u) ✓**, but the
  3 cross-platform binary jobs FAILED at `cargo deny` — `error[wildcard]`: the new country crates reference
  internal crates by `path` with no `version`, which `wildcards = "deny"` rejects. The GitHub release v0.1.0
  was created (not draft) but carries only the OpenAPI assets.
- **Fix:** added `allow-wildcard-paths = true` to `deny.toml [bans]` — intra-workspace path deps legitimately
  carry no version (GitHub-only, not yet on crates.io); registry-crate wildcards stay denied; existing pins
  untouched. Verified locally: `cargo deny check bans licenses sources advisories` = **advisories ok, bans ok,
  licenses ok, sources ok** (cargo-deny 0.19.7).
- **Decisions:** D10 — fix the release-blocking wildcard lint via `allow-wildcard-paths = true` rather than
  pinning `version` on ~170 path deps across 34 country crates: one reviewable line, idiomatic cargo-deny,
  prevents recurrence as the serializer set grows, and preserves the strict registry-wildcard gate.
- **Next:** commit deny.toml; move the `v0.1.0` tag to the fixed commit to rebuild + attach the cross-platform
  binaries (release skill standard tag-iteration); confirm the release carries binaries → close L1.
